Chess Game

To Do (for game itself):
1. Set up turns between players.
2. Implement actually moving pieces.
3. Implement a block for placing oneself in 'check' (or making a move in check)
4. Implement a check for 'checkmate' (should be easy after previous one).
5. Place a div at the bottom of the screen informing users of relevant game
   information.

To Do (for 2 sessions):
1. Support 2 independent sessions playing against one another.
2. Let players decide black/white (otherwise random).


To Do (for playing against anybody):
No clue how to do this yet, but make it so that people can login with a unique
userid/password, and then be matched with other players to play.

Later implement rankings and such.

Long-term goal is to make an AI that can play against players.
