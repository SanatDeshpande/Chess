Chess Game

To Do (for game itself):
1. Set up board
2. Code pieces
    - this includes initial position and movement for each piece
    - make sure no illegal moves are allowed
3. Implement check/checkmate checking
4. Implement players taking turns


To Do (for playing against anybody):
No clue how to do this yet, but make it so that people can login with a unique
userid/password, and then be matched with other players to play.

Later implement rankings and such.

Long-term goal is to make an AI that can play against players.
